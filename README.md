# Unturned Difficulty Adjuster
Unturned Difficulty Adjuster is an OpenMod plugin for Unturned that gives server owners a greater number of options for how they want to configure the experience on their server.
The plugin was developed to solve my personal dissatisfaction with the base game's balance (ie. kiting a zombie and punching it to death is a valid strategy).
The aim of the plugin is not to completely overwrite the original gameplay experience, but to instead permit alterations to it which make loot much more hard-earned and valuable.

All components of the mod are currently non-optional, although this may change in the future, and are detailed in the Configuration section below.

## Configuration
All configuration is done through the plugin's `config.yml` file, which can normally be found in `U3DS/Servers/<SERVER NAME>/OpenMod/plugins/UnturnedDifficultyAdjuster`.
For more information on how to configure the plugin, check the default config file which includes how to override all melee and ranged weapons, how to change the limb damage settings, and how to apply an override to a specific weapon (by ID).
